# Impeachment Project
This is a project about data visualization using [Chart.js](www.chartjs.org) about the voting for the Impeachment proccess of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.

### You can see the preview [here](http://impeachment.herokuapp.com/).

### Configuration
To get this running you will need:

* Chart.js
* NodeJS
* Express
* Angular
* Underscore

There is probably a better way to do all of its functions using less libraries, but as I am learning all of them I will keep it always changing.

First of all you will need to install **NodeJS**, there are many ways of doing that, you can find more Infos [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Than go to the project's root and run:

```
npm install underscore--save
npm install express --save
npm install angular --save
```

Or simply run using the package.json:

```
npm install
```

You can get Chart.js [here](www.chartjs.org).

#### As I'm acctually working on this project the libs are a little bit messy, but soon it will be fixed.


Thanks to [In√°cio Schweller](https://github.com/schweller) who made the JSON online and free for all brazilians developers.
